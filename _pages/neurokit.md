This page will be updated throughout the first day, but in the meantime you can find detailed instructions in the following document: [Hardware Instructions](https://neurogears-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/g_lopes_neurogears_org/ERI2YoXdKVhJhUypwCm4Qa0B9-9_7280LWMvAAe_2CP91Q?e=96PrCv).

When attending this course, you should have received a NeuroKit containing the following components:

  * 1x Webcam ([**url**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07KMXR1BR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1))
  * 1x Arduino starter kit:
    * 1x DFRduino (or just a normal Arduino) ([**url**](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-838.html))
    * 1x I/O expansion shield ([**url**](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1009.html))
    * 1x Gravity sensor kit ([**url**](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-725.html))
    * 1x USB cable ([**url**](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-134.html))
    * 1x Bag of analog sensor jumpers ([**url**](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-128.html))
    * 1x Bag of digital sensor/servo jumpers ([**url**](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-124.html))
  * 1x Pan-Tilt Assembly ([**url**](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-146.html))
  * Hexbug Nano ([**url**](https://www.hexbug.com/hexbug-nano-5-pack-4-nano-plus-bonus-flash-nano.html))

**Note:** You will need to assemble the Pan and Tilt motor kits to finish some of the closed-loop exercises. The assembly can also double as a support base from your camera. Below are the assembly instructions:
